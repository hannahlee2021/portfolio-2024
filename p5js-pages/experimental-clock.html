        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <h4><b>what is it?</b></h4>
        <p>a clock that accounts for how time progresses or interacts with specific medications i consume</p>
        <h4><b>intent</b></h4>
        <p>to imagine medication interactions as a channel of time, while also encountering changes in its progression
            due to sudden events in life (life and its unpredicatibility... >.>)

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <h4><b>design</b></h4>
        <p>coming soon....</p>
        <!-- <p>i used figma to create the website design, and i had a lot of fun playing around! initially, the design i had in mind emulated
            spotify, with the black + green color scheme and the same widgets. however, i ended up dropping the idea because i wanted to create something more original / personal to me. i am glad i decided to change my idea because i think it works better with the concept of my project</p> -->
        <br>
        <h4><b>build</b></h4>
        <p>coming soon....</p>
        <!-- <p>at first, i struggled a bit trying to figure out how to translate my design on figma into code. i never really used html/css extensively
            before, so trying to learn and incorporate it into my ideas was a bit daunting at first. however, the learning curve happened quite fast for me luckily, so i was able to get the hang of it
            in time. i also struggled with figuring out how to implement my p5js sketch into the site, since directly embedding it did not provide the user experience i was hoping for. i ended up copy and pasting my p5js sketch code into a js file and tweaking my code directly on the vscode interface to fit the website design! i also made a lot of silly mistakes throughout the process, which slowed down my process quite a bit (spent more than half my time troubleshooting ＞﹏＜). for example, the javascript i implemented into the faq page would not work for the longest time and i could not figure out what went wrong. however, after a kindred spirit on stack overflow mentioned to check the script tag in the html file, i realized i linked 2 separate js files with the same code into the html sheet! 
        </p> -->
        <br>
        <h4><b>conclusion</b></h4>
        <p>coming soon....</p>
        <!-- <p>i am proud of myself for being able to debug most of the issues i had as well as creating a functioning site despite my limited experience in html/css! i realized that i really enjoy this kind of work and would love to continue this journey of website creating in the future as both a hobby and even a career!</p> -->
