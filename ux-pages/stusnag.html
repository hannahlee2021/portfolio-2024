        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <h4><b>what is it?</b></h4>
        <p>a prospective mobile app where students within a university campus can snag and give away groceries! </p>
        <h4><b>intent</b></h4>
        <p>the app is aimed at college students who want to practice sustainability, maximize a tight budget, and foster campus community!</p>

        <h2>STAGE 1: DEFINE</h2>
        <h3>1. prompt</h3>
        <p>for this was a school project, we were given the prompt by the professor, which was to create a cooking/recipe app. 
            however, it was in our hands to hone in on a specific avenue, and our guiding problem ended up being “how can we 
            come up with a solution to the reality of tight student budgets and inevitable food waste when groceries aren’t able 
            to be used in time?”. however, it is important to note that when we initially began this journey, we were pursuing to 
            create a standard recipe application, but sometime in the middle of the research process, we felt compelled to shift.</p>

            <h2>STAGE 2: RESEARCH</h2>

            <h3>1. landscaping</h3>
            <img src = "stusnag-prog/landscaping-img.jpeg" width="50%" height="auto">
            <p>to kickstart the research, my collaborator and i looked at competing apps within this market and noted each one’s strengths/weaknesses, 
                target audiences, and key features/user flows alonside some additional takeaways. all the apps seemed to follow a consistent set of features, 
                such as searching, categories, and saving capabilities, as well as similar information architecture, with the searching feature residing at the 
                top of the screen, and a nav bar at the bottom.  </p>

            <h3>2. field research</h3>
            <div class = "field-research-img-cont">
           <img src="stusnag-prog/field-research-1.png" width="30%" height="auto">
           <img src="stusnag-prog/user-journey.png" width="30%" height="auto">
        </div>
            <p>we then placed ourselves in the consumers’ shoes, using the app YUMMLY as our recipe guide and following one of the recipes within the app. we mapped out the flow of our emotions/experience throughout the process, and we in particular felt frustration when trying to navigate the recipe due to the actual recipe (on a separate blog post) listing different ingredients than the app. </p>

            <h3>3. user persona</h3>
            <img src = "stusnag-prog/persona-ideation-1.png" width="50%" height="auto">
            <p>to kickstart the research, my collaborator and i looked at competing apps within this market and noted each one’s strengths/weaknesses, 
                target audiences, and key features/user flows alonside some additional takeaways. all the apps seemed to follow a consistent set of features, 
                such as searching, categories, and saving capabilities, as well as similar information architecture, with the searching feature residing at the 
                top of the screen, and a nav bar at the bottom.  
                
                <p><span style="color:#2DF400; font-size: larger;">persona</span></p>
                <img src="stusnag-prog/user-persona-revised.png" width="50%" height="auto">
                <p>taking from the ideation, we decided to look inwardly at ourselves since we were both members of the demographic we were trying to target. we both found that we often had frustrations related to waste, lack of motivation to cook, and unhealthy eating habits due to the chaos of student life. we decided to encapsulate a version of both of us into a persona, and we landed on naming our person gojo (jjk fans you know what’s up ;p), and making their background reflect not just ourselves, but college students as a whole. </p>
                
            </p>
       
        <h2>STAGE 3: IDEATE</h2>
        <h3>1. sitemap</h3>
        <img src="stusnag-prog/sitemap-revised.png"  width="50%" height="auto">
        <p>taking from the research we conducted alongside our persona, we thought 
            about what components we wanted in our app alongside the architecture. 
            we followed the general layout many cooking recipes had in terms of 
            chronological categorization, but we centered our swap feature since 
            it was the core feature of our app.</p>

        <h3>2. user flows & storyboards</h3>
        <p><span style="color:#2DF400; font-size: larger;">need 1</span></p>
        <div class = "user-flow-cont-1">

        <p>for the new interface, i want to focus on making the experience more user friendly and clean by following the style of a more professional website style. i want to utilize design choices like colors and composition that allow for easy legibility and an overall seamless experience. right now, my inspiration for the design is derived from the cyber y2k aesthetic, with smooth, metallic tones</p> -->


        <h2>STAGE 4: PROTOTYPE</h2>
        <h3>1. wireframe</h3>
        <div class = "wireframe-cont">
        <img src="stusnag-prog/home-wireframe.png" >
        <img src="stusnag-prog/snag-wireframe.png" >
        <img src="stusnag-prog/upload+notif-wireframe.png">
        </div>
        <p>taking from our previous research, we created a few wireframes &#40;home, snags, upload, notification&#41; to help us visualize the app's layout and flow. our main goal was to get the core interaction and structure, 
            before committing to details and the final design.

        <p>coming soon....</p>



        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        
        <h4><b>design</b></h4>
        <p>coming soon....</p>
        <!-- <p>i used figma to create the website design, and i had a lot of fun playing around! initially, the design i had in mind emulated
            spotify, with the black + green color scheme and the same widgets. however, i ended up dropping the idea because i wanted to create something more original / personal to me. i am glad i decided to change my idea because i think it works better with the concept of my project</p>
        <br> -->
        <h4><b>build</b></h4>
        <p>coming soon....</p>
        <!-- <p>at first, i struggled a bit trying to figure out how to translate my design on figma into code. i never really used html/css extensively
            before, so trying to learn and incorporate it into my ideas was a bit daunting at first. however, the learning curve happened quite fast for me luckily, so i was able to get the hang of it
            in time. i also struggled with figuring out how to implement my p5js sketch into the site, since directly embedding it did not provide the user experience i was hoping for. i ended up copy and pasting my p5js sketch code into a js file and tweaking my code directly on the vscode interface to fit the website design! i also made a lot of silly mistakes throughout the process, which slowed down my process quite a bit (spent more than half my time troubleshooting ＞﹏＜). for example, the javascript i implemented into the faq page would not work for the longest time and i could not figure out what went wrong. however, after a kindred spirit on stack overflow mentioned to check the script tag in the html file, i realized i linked 2 separate js files with the same code into the html sheet! 
        </p> -->
        <br>
        <h4><b>conclusion</b></h4>
        <p>coming soon....</p>
        <!-- <p>i am proud of myself for being able to debug most of the issues i had as well as creating a functioning site despite my limited experience in html/css! i realized that i really enjoy this kind of work and would love to continue this journey of website creating in the future as both a hobby and even a career!</p> -->
