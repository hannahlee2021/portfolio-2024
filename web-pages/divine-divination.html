        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <h4><b>what is it?</b></h4>
        <p>a virtual divination ritual utilizing the concept of bloodletting as a means of divination</p>
        <h4><b>intent</b></h4>
        <p>to reimagine the physicality of divination rituals in a web based platform</p>

        <h2>DESIGN</h2>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); width: 600px; height: 300px;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F958Md6qiWIblN1IAOvjvPu%2Fdivine-divination-sketch%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3Dgq7L2t1jbV2JjXrQ-1" allowfullscreen="" class=""></iframe>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>for the design/concept, i derived the overall idea of utilizing blood as an element after donating blood. stemming off this experience, i thought back to the ancient ritual of bloodletting, and while it was not explicitly used for divination purposes, i wanted to spin the practice in a divination lens. the fortune part, i wanted to utilize the rita.js haiku generator, since it produces cryptic messages made possible by the randomness of rita.js.</p>

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <h4><b>design</b></h4>
        <p>creating the assets on procreate were probably the most time consuming part of the design process! however, i really wanted to use my own assets for this project and am glad with how it turned out! as for the figma design, i had a clear vision of how i wanted the “ritual” to go, and so i did not encounter much road blocks in the creative process. </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>build</b></h4>
        <p>i had a few hiccups along the way of building the site from start to end! integrating the rita.js library was a bit of a pain, but after some troubleshooting i was able to make it work to a certain extent... also, figuring out the timing for the css animtions took some trial and error, but i think i have reached a good conclusion. i was inspired by this <a href="https://codepen.io/yaclive/pen/EayLYO">codepen</a> for the scene with falling text and proud of finding a way to integrate it into my project in my own style! i also got a lot of practice with css animations and so that was quite a lovely time! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>conclusion</b></h4>
        <p>overall, i am glad with how the ritual turned out and i learned quite a lot along the way! sometimes, i like to revisit the site for days where im not sure where life is taking me hehe</p>
