        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <h4><b>what is it?</b></h4>
        <p>a web based composition responding to louise drulhe's <a href="https://louisedrulhe.fr/internet-atlas/"><i>critical atlas of the internet</i></a></p>
        <h4><b>intent</b></h4>
        <p>to create a new piece that takes a pre-existing web piece as inspiration and a starting point.</p>

        <br>
        <p>to start off the process, i took notes about drulhe’s work, noting my thoughts, interesting parts, and cool imagery. for the layout, i wanted to retain the general integrity of the original piece, and so i decided to incorporate some of the images used in the work. i was inspired by how the piece talks about the internet and it’s relation to the physical world; it reminded me of the earth and its relation to greater space, and so i felt drawn to design my response in a somewhat galactic theme.</p>

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <h4><b>design</b></h4>
        <p>i found that coming up with the visual design for this piece was a pretty enjoyable experience overall! there were some constraints that had me thinking for a bit, such as the site having to be contained within a single page. but other than that, i think laying out the visual design went quite smoothly partly due to having a pre-existing work as a starting point for inspiration.</p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>build</b></h4>
        <p>the building process was pretty alright! i would not say it was 100% smooth, but i did not run into too many roadblocks either. one thing i did ponder about was the navigation of the site. first, i intended to use parallax scrolling, but i decided to just do regular scrolling but integrate a “table of content”-esque navigation bar so the user can get to each section faster if they wish. i decided to change my idea due to not wanting too much similarity between mine and drulhe’s work. figuring out how to make this navigation tool work was a bit of a challenge, but i ultimately decided to use put each section into a nav id and make links directing each number to the assigned section.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>conclusion</b></h4>
        <p>overall, i am glad with how the final product came out! the general integrity of the original work is there, but i also believe i was able to let my identity as an artist peak through! i also learned a lot about designing within constraints and bouncing off of pre-existing ideas.</p>
